 <h1>Hayley Smith</h1>
 <h2>graduating in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>

 <p>I am graduating this year with an associates degree in libral arts where I hope to pursue digital art such as graphic design.</p>
 <p>
 I also enjoy photography and like to practice those skills as often as I can. my dream job would be a traveling photographer, but that is a hard job to get into. &amp;
 </p>
 <p>
 My current plan is to become a graphic designer and work remotly so that I am still free to travel.
